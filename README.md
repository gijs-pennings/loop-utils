A production-ready, state-of-the-art collection of flexible, blazingly fast utility functions for early adopters of [Loop](https://looplang.org/). Features include:
- A random number generator (which is surely uniform) for integers between 0 and 134456 and arrays thereof
- A stable, in-place sorting algorithm that is asymptotically as fast as QuickSort (which is very quickâ€”it's in the name after all)

## How to use
For a quick demo:
1. [Download Loop](https://downloads.looplang.org/) and add it to PATH
2. Browse to `./src`
3. Run `loop test.loop`

This was tested for build 188.
